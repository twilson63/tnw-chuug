# CHUUG - WORD COUNT Challenge

Rules:

Your program should take a path to a file as  command line argument. The path will be a flat file of URLs separated by carriage return. The URLs will point to a page of text. Your program should output a text file containing the aggregate word counts for all the URLs contained in the flat file. Additionally, your program should also display the time it took from initial invocation to the completion of writing the output file.

I will set up a server on Digital Ocean for you to deploy to tonight. Hit me up with a private message to get the credentials.

If you are doing DotNet you will need to run on Mono or have your own server. I'll post the Specs of the Digital Ocean one after I set it up.
